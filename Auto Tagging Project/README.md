# Auto Tagging

- Topic Models
  > A topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents. Topic modeling is a frequently used text-mining tool for the discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body. 
  > Topic Modeling in NLP seeks to find hidden semantic structure in documents. They are probabilistic models that can help you comb through massive amounts of raw text and cluster similar groups of documents together in an unsupervised way.

- Automated text classification (Text/Data Classification)
  > Text classification is a smart classification of text into categories. Text classification or Text Categorization is the activity of labeling natural language texts with relevant categories from a predefined set. In laymen terms, text classification is a process of extracting generic tags from unstructured text. These generic tags come from a set of pre-defined categories. Classifying your content and products into categories help users to easily search and navigate within website or application.

### Harder Way

- Text Summarization


It needs special loss functions, sampling at training time and methods like building a stack of multiple classifiers each refining the results of previous one to solve this problem.
