# Topic Modeling

Topic modelling is an unsupervised machine learning method that **helps us discover hidden semantic structures in a paper**, that allows us to learn topic representations of papers in a corpus. The model can be applied to any kinds of labels on documents, such as tags on posts on the website.

##  Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

### The Process

- We pick the number of topics ahead of time even if weâ€™re not sure what the topics are.
- Each document is represented as a distribution over topics.
- Each topic is represented as a distribution over words.
